# Codika Bundled Blocks ðŸ§±

This repository manages versioned Mason blocks for the Codika platform. It provides a centralized location for all bundled blocks and maintains version history for easy rollback and tracking.

## Overview

The bundling system:

- Takes Mason blocks from `~/.codika/codika_blocks/blocks`
- Bundles them using the Mason CLI
- Maintains versioned copies with timestamps
- Provides easy access to the latest version
- Keeps version history with metadata
